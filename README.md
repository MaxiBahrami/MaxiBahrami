<!-- Greeting -->
<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm <a href="https://your-website.com">Maximilian</a> 👋</h1>

<!-- Short description -->
<p align="center">Once upon a time, many years ago, I was a child who loved computers, gaming, and anything digital. I started downloading and installing apps and programs, experimenting with them out of pure curiosity. A few years later, I already knew how to work with almost any app on a PC or mobile phone. I was incredibly curious, but at the time, I didn’t fully understand what fueled that curiosity—until I heard about Java. This was about fifteen years ago, and it sparked my journey into programming.

I began learning Java and writing code. Back then, programming wasn’t as accessible as it is today. I had to rely on books and articles to teach myself. Despite the challenges, I loved the process of learning, being creative, writing code, and testing it. When my odd bits of code actually worked, I felt an immense sense of joy and wanted to hug everyone around me out of excitement.

I continued my journey, learning more and more along the way. I went to university to deepen my understanding of data and systems, but it still wasn’t enough for me. I pursued additional knowledge in web development, combining it with my academic studies.

I absolutely LOVE creating, developing, and programming. It’s not just a profession for me—it’s a passion that has shaped my life.
